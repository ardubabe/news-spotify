# My Spotify Interface

This awesome interface uses the [news API](https://newsapi.org/) and the [spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login) to pull keywords from news headlines to create playlists based on artists names with the same keywords



## Setup

you need a news api key, instructions on how to get the keys



for the spotify keys, i use this format

{
    "username": "your-username",
    "client_id": "your-client-id",
    "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
    "redirect": "http://google.com/"
}
